                <p>Ever since my teenage years, i started to watch foreign media on television that was in english language. Through this and games i improved my English
                    to the level where i can speak it fluently. I generally love to learn languages and I'm currently considering going to Oxford language school to perfect my English 
                    skill to the highest degree.

                <p> Recenetly I started helping my mother with some of her work. Since she is a bookkeeper, i got to learn the basics of accounting and bookkeeping. Alongside this,
                i studied these subjects in college and have been gaining more and more interest in it. I'm currently working on improving my knowledge in this field and im willing
                to put in the hours needed to perfect my craft.</p>

                    I learned web developing throughout my highshcool and college days. I got a solid grasp on most of the technologies needed for frontend developing.
                    As of recent i have started a dual project with my menthor, David, and that will be one of my biggest frontend projects yet. I'm very excited to see how it turns out
                    and hopefully it can propell my career and my exposure as a young web developer.

                <p>Hollow Knight has been my favourite game ever since i played it for the first time. It's a metroidvania filled with amazing music, art and even a deep lore 
                    if you are into those stuffs. I have put approximately 300+ hours into it and i dont plan on stopping. I have gotten every achievement there is and i plan on
                    completing some more complex tasks that a very few people can do. I would also like to get into speedrunning the game.
